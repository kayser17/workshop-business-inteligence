# Workshop – Business Intelligence (APSV – MSc Telecommunications Engineering, UPM)

This repository contains two notebooks developed for the *Business Intelligence* module of the **APSV subject** within the **Master’s Degree in Telecommunications Engineering (MUIT)** at the **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)**.

## Workshop – Data Exploration

This workshop introduces students to **data exploration and descriptive analytics** using Python.  
The objective is to analyze a dataset of train trips and transported cargo to extract meaningful insights.

Key topics:
- Loading and cleaning data with **Pandas**
- Exploring columns, missing values, and data types
- Computing descriptive statistics
- Visualizing data with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Deriving insights about trip duration, cargo type, and fuel consumption

---

## Workshop – Machine Learning

This workshop builds upon the previous one by introducing **supervised learning** techniques with **scikit-learn**.

### Regression Task
Predict the **fuel consumption** of a train trip using:
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

Metrics used: **MAE**, **RMSE**, **R²**

### Classification Task
Predict the **type of cargo** transported by a train using:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

Metrics used: **F1-Score** and **feature importance**

Students compare models, evaluate performance, and use trained models to make predictions for new trips.
